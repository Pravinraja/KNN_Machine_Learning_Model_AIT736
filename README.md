# KNN_Machine_Learning_Model_AIT736
A sample coded use case of K-NN or a decision tree classifier where we applied to solve a real-world problem. Â We will be describing the application, related data, training protocol, results. In this sample for the KNN ML Algorithm, we will use the topic of Parkinson's Disease Detection
